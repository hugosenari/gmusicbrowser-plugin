My gmusicbrowser plugins

zeitgeist plugin:
Isn't working because perl dbus lib (https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=73313)
Solving this problem, this will work. For some reason Activity Journal doesn't show this logs, but Synapse shows.
You can try this extension for zeitgeist that works too https://github.com/hugosenari/zeitgeist-extensions
